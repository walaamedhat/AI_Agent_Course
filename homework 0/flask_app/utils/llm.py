"""
llm.py — sends messages to an AI language model via the OpenRouter API.

This file is the bridge between your Flask app and an AI model (GPT-3.5).
When a student types a message in the chat, it travels here, gets sent to
OpenRouter, and the AI's reply comes back.

KEY CONCEPTS:
  - API (Application Programming Interface): a way for two programs to talk
    to each other over the internet. OpenRouter exposes an API we can call.
  - HTTP POST request: sending data to a server (like submitting a form).
    We POST the conversation to OpenRouter and it POSTs back the AI reply.
  - System prompt: instructions given to the AI before the conversation starts.
    Think of it as the AI's job description.

# Which AI model to use. OpenRouter supports many models.
# Models with ':free' suffix are free to use — no API credits needed.

# QUESTION: What would change if you switched to a different model?

def send_message(user_message, system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."):
    """
    Send a message to the AI and return its response as a string.

    Args:
        user_message  (str): The message the user typed in the chat.
        system_prompt (str): Instructions that define how the AI should behave.
                             This is sent before the user message, every time.

    Returns:
        str: The AI's reply text, or an error message if something went wrong.

    HOW IT WORKS:
        We build a 'messages' list with two entries:
          1. system — gives the AI its instructions (the resume context)
          2. user   — the student's actual question
        We send this list to OpenRouter, which forwards it to the AI model
        and returns the generated reply.

    # NOTE: This function has no memory — each call starts fresh.
    #       Every message includes the full system prompt but no chat history.
    # QUESTION: How would you modify this to remember previous messages?
    #           Hint: you would need to store past messages and include them
    #           in the 'messages' list between the system and user entries.
