"""
__init__.py — creates and configures the Flask application.

This file is the entry point for the flask_app package. Its job is to:
  1. Load configuration (API keys from .env)
  2. Set up the database (create tables, load CSV data)
  3. Register routes (the URL paths the app responds to)
  4. Set up Socket.IO (for real-time chat)
  5. Return the configured app so app.py can run it

WHY A create_app() FUNCTION?
  Wrapping setup in a function (rather than running code at import time)
  is a common Flask pattern. It makes the app easier to test and configure.
  This pattern is called an "application factory".

# QUESTION: What does purge=True do in db.createTables(purge=True)?
#           Try changing it to False, add a row to a CSV, and restart.
#           What happens? Why?
